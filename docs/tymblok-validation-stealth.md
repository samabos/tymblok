# Tymblok Stealth Validation: Research-Framed Approach

> Validate demand without revealing your product concept to competitors

---

## Core Principle

**Frame everything as "research" or "curiosity" — never as a product you're building.**

You're a developer exploring a topic, not a founder pitching an idea.

## Survey Version (Google Forms / Typeform)

**Title:** "Developer Focus & Energy Patterns — Quick Research Survey"

**Intro:**

> I'm researching how developers experience focus and mental energy throughout the workday. This is for personal research — not selling anything. Takes 3-4 minutes. All responses anonymous.

- [ ] Somewhat valuable
- [ ] Neutral
- [ ] Not valuable
- [ ] I can already tell this myself

**Q12.** What information do you think would best predict your focus readiness? (Select up to 3)

- [ ] How long since my last break
- [ ] My calendar load today
- [ ] How my previous coding session went
- [ ] Physical stress indicators (heart rate, etc.)
- [ ] Self-reported mood

- [ ] Could be misused by employers
- [ ] Nothing — I'd be open to trying it
- [ ] Other: \_\_\_

**Q15.** Would you pay for something that saved you 5+ hours per week of unproductive "zombie coding"?

- [ ] Yes, definitely
- [ ] Probably, if it actually worked
- [ ] Maybe, depends on price
- [ ] No, I'd only use something free
- [ ] No, I don't think this problem is solvable

> - Q5: Sleep + meetings + breaks selected = confirms multi-factor causes
> - Q11: >50% "extremely/somewhat valuable" = desire exists
> - Q12: If respondents pick sleep + coding patterns + stress indicators = validates your approach without you suggesting it

## Reddit Discussion Posts (Stealth)

### Version A: Pure Research Framing

**Subreddits:** r/ExperiencedDevs, r/cscareerquestions, r/programming

**Title:** "How do you know when you're too tired to code well?"

**Body:**

Genuine question — not promoting anything.

I've been reflecting on my own productivity patterns and realized I'm pretty bad at recognizing when I'm mentally drained. I'll schedule a focus block, sit down, and an hour later realize I've barely made progress. Looking back, the signs were there (bad sleep, stressful morning) but I didn't connect the dots.

Curious how other devs handle this:

1. Do you have a reliable way to know when you're in a good headspace for deep work?

2. Have you noticed patterns in what causes your "off" days?

3. Do you track anything (sleep, activity, whatever) that helps?

Not looking for productivity hacks or tool recommendations — more interested in how people think about this.

---

### Version B: Contrarian Take

**Subreddits:** r/ExperiencedDevs, r/programming

**Title:** "Hot take: Most productivity advice ignores that some days you just shouldn't code"

**Body:**

I've tried all the usual stuff — Pomodoro, time blocking, calendar management. But none of it addresses the real problem: sometimes I sit down to work and my brain just isn't there.

Doesn't matter how perfectly I've scheduled my day. If I slept poorly or I'm stressed, that 2-hour focus block is wasted before it starts.

Anyone else feel like the productivity discourse completely ignores the biological side? We're not machines that perform consistently given the right calendar setup.

How do you handle days when you're just... not capable of good work?

---

### Version C: Storytelling

**Subreddits:** r/ExperiencedDevs, r/cscareerquestions

**Title:** "I tracked my coding sessions for 3 months. Here's what actually predicted my good vs bad days."

**Body:**

Did a personal experiment. For 3 months, I rated each coding session (1-5) and tracked a few variables: sleep hours, meetings that day, time of day, days since last break.

Findings (for me at least):

- Sleep was the #1 predictor. Under 6 hours = almost always a bad session
- Afternoon sessions after 2+ hours of meetings were 70% worse than morning sessions
- My best work happened between 9-11am, but I rarely protected that time

Nothing groundbreaking, but it made me realize how little attention I pay to my own patterns.

Anyone else done something similar? Curious what you've found.

## Twitter/X Posts (Stealth)

### Thread 1: Observation, Not Pitch

**Tweet 1:**
Something I've noticed: I'm terrible at knowing when I'm too tired to code well.

I'll schedule focus time, sit down, and an hour later realize I've written garbage.

The signs were there. I just ignored them.

**Tweet 2:**
Started paying attention to what predicts my bad sessions:

- Poor sleep (obvious in hindsight)
- 2+ hours of meetings before coding
- Skipping lunch or breaks
- Starting deep work after 3pm

**Tweet 3:**
The weird part: I _know_ these patterns but still schedule deep work at bad times.

It's like knowing you shouldn't eat junk food but doing it anyway.

Anyone else feel this disconnect?

---

### Thread 2: Question Only

**Tweet 1:**
Question for devs:

How do you know when you're in a good headspace for deep coding work vs. when you should do something easier?

Genuine question — I'm bad at this.

---

## Hacker News Post (Stealth)

**Title:** Ask HN: How do you assess your own readiness for deep work?

**Body:**

I've been thinking about personal productivity and realized I'm poor at knowing when I'm actually ready for focused coding vs. when I should do lighter tasks.

I'll block time for deep work but sit down already mentally depleted from poor sleep or a stressful morning. An hour in, I've made little progress and the time is wasted.

Curious how others approach this:

1. Do you have signals you pay attention to before starting focused work?

2. Have you found patterns in what predicts your productive vs. unproductive sessions?

3. Does anyone actually adjust their schedule based on how they're feeling, or do you just push through?

Not looking for tool recommendations — more interested in frameworks or habits.

## Interview Script (Stealth)

**Framing:** "I'm doing personal research on developer productivity — specifically around energy and focus patterns. Just trying to understand how people experience this."

### Questions

1. "Walk me through yesterday. When did you do your best coding work? When did you struggle?"

2. "What do you think made the difference between those times?"

3. "How do you decide what time of day to tackle your hardest tasks?"

4. "Have you ever scheduled focus time and then realized you weren't capable of using it well? What happened?"

5. "Do you track anything about your work or health? Has it influenced how you work?"

6. "If you could know in advance whether the next 2 hours would be productive or not, what would you do differently?"

7. "What's the main reason you don't pay more attention to your energy levels when planning your day?"

8. "Is there anything you wish you understood better about your own productivity patterns?"

## What You NEVER Say

❌ "I'm building a tool that..."
❌ "Imagine a product that combines..."
❌ "Would you use an app that..."
❌ "VS Code extension"
❌ "Biometrics / wearables / HRV"
❌ "Cognitive load"
❌ "Adaptive scheduling"

✅ "I'm researching..."

## Engagement Strategy

When people reply to your posts:

**If they describe the exact problem you're solving:**

> "That's exactly what I've been experiencing. Have you found anything that helps?"

**If they suggest a solution close to yours:**

> "Interesting. Do you think that would actually work?"

**If they're skeptical:**

> "Fair point. What would make you believe something like that could work?"

**Never:**

> "Actually I'm building something for this..."

Save the reveal for when you have an MVP and validation data.
